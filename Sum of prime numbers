Check if a prime number can be expressed as sum of two Prime Numbers
 
Given a prime number 

N. The task is to check if it is possible to express 

N as sum of two separate prime numbers.

Note: The range of N is less than 108.

Examples:

Input : N = 13
Output : Yes
Explanation : The number 13 can be written as 11 + 2, 
here 11 and 2 are both prime.

Input : N = 11
Output : No
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Simple Solution: A simple solution is to create a sieve to store all the prime numbers less than the number N. Then run a loop from 1 to N and check whether 

i and 

n-i are both prime or not. If yes then print Yes, else No.

Efficient solution: Apart from 2, all of the prime numbers are odd. So it is not possible to represent a prime number (which is odd) to be written as a sum of two odd prime numbers, so we are sure that one of the two prime number should be 2. So we have to check whether n-2 is prime or not. If it holds we print Yes else No.



For example, if the number is 19 then we have to check whether 19-2 = 17 is a prime number or not. If 17 is a prime number then print yes otherwise print no.

Below is the implementation of the above approach:

// C++ program to check if a prime number 
// can be expressed as sum of 
// two Prime Numbers 
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 

using namespace std; 

  
// Function to check whether a number 
// is prime or not 

bool isPrime(int n) 
{ 

    if (n <= 1) 

        return false; 

  

    for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++) { 

        if (n % i == 0) 

            return false; 

    } 

  

    return true; 
} 

  
// Function to check if a prime number 
// can be expressed as sum of 
// two Prime Numbers 

bool isPossible(int N) 
{ 

    // if the number is prime, 

    // and number-2 is also prime 

    if (isPrime(N) && isPrime(N - 2)) 

        return true; 

    else

        return false; 
} 

  
// Driver code 

int main() 
{ 

    int n = 13; 

  

    if (isPossible(n)) 

        cout << "Yes"; 

    else

        cout << "No"; 

  

    return 0; 
} 
Output:
Yes
